            <h3>Scratch Project CSP</h3>
            <h4>September 2018</h4>
            <p>This was an assigned school project for my Computer Science 
            Principles class where we needed to create a Scratch game.  In 
            this project, my partner and I decided to make a Fortnite themed 
            Super Smash Bros style game where players must be the last one 
            alive.  It is currently still in development due to the enormous 
            variety of features planned to be implemented.  Teamwork was 
            important in this project due to us not being able to work on the 
            same Scratch game at the same time.  It required constant 
            coordination and so we designated parts for each of us to complete. 
            We also made sure we had days when we would remix each other's 
            projects to keep the features up to date.</p>

            <h3>MIT App Inventor Project</h3>
            <h4>October 2018</h4>
            <p>This project was assinged in my Computer Science Principles class 
            and students had to pick a tutorial and build off of it to make 
            our own apps.  In this project my partner and I coded a state 
            geography quiz using blocks in MIT App Inventor.  We then used 
            tablets to display our newly created apps.  The most difficult 
            aspect of this project was the limits of MIT App Inventor itself, 
            and getting used to the way blocks are used.  Many blocks were 
            unable to be customized in the way that would be most efficient to
            compile code, so there were constant problems in making sure pieces 
            of code worked the way we wanted it to.  We solved this problem by 
            constantly running the app on the tablets as a test after we change 
            even the smallest part of code, so we can see exactly which blocks 
            need to be fixed.</p>

            <h3>Image Manipulation Project</h3>
            <h4>October 2018</h4>
            <p>This project required extensive research to figure out multiple
            ways to add shapes and frames onto any given image.  This took over
            three weeks to complete, and I was successful in creating four 
            different functions utilizing multiple libraries to add frames. The
            project was created with Python programming, and images were put as 
            input to make four different outputs, each a different frame.</p>
