              <h4><u>General:</u></h4>
              <p>Hi, welcome to my online portfolio!  I am Mark Owen Macasaet, 
              and I am a freshman at Dublin High School.  I am always focused on 
              my studies and I put my best effort in every subject I take.  In 
              my free time, I enjoy playing video games, mainly Fortnite, and I 
              love competing against others when playing.  As a hobby as well as 
              for school, I practice the violin, and I have been doing so for 
              about 4 years now.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <h4><u>Career Goal:</u></h4>
              <p>As of now, I am freshman trying to figure out where to 
              go next in my life plan.  I am looking to obtain a job as an 
              aerospace engineer, which is a job that I would probably enjoy the 
              most.  I am interested in design and I want to be able to make 
              scientific discoveries that make a difference in the world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <h4><u>Qualities and Skills:</u></h4>
              <p>I excel in being creative in everyday activities as well as 
              academic work.  I put my best effort in all my work and practices 
              that pay off in the best results.  I stay determined and persevere 
              through all hardships, and I do not give up.  I have basic coding 
              skills consisting of coding for HTML, CSS, Command Line, 
              Bootstrap, and Python.  I am in an advanced class for math 
              (Algebra 2/Trigonometry) that is above my current grade level.  I 
              focus on studies and prioritize it more than other activities.  I 
              also am a very good leader, and I can be part of a team.  For 
              example, I am part of the Dublin High School Orchestra, where I 
              have to make sure I contribute as much as I can.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <h4><u>Achievements:</u></h4>
              <p>I succeeded in many activities throughout my life, the most 
              important being academically.  I am taking many advanced classes 
              for this year of highschool so I can really challenge myself.  I 
              currently have a 4.0 GPA, from all my classes having high grades.  
              In my extracurricular activities, I have earned a black belt in 
              martial arts after attending for 5-years, and I have improved 
              greatly in playing violin since I have started practicing 4 years 
              ago.</p>
